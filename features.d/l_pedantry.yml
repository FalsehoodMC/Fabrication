	desc:
		TNT is renamed to Dynamite and doesn't say TNT on it. TNT is more stable than Minecraft's
		representation of it, and the texture is clearly dynamite.

		(Technically dynamite is made from nitroglycerin, but nitro is so incredibly unstable that
		you would need to change a dozen different mechanics to make it "correct".)

		Gunpowder is also renamed to Creeper Dust, because gunpowder is not that explosive.
