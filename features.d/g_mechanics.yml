mechanics.enhanced_moistness:
	name: Enhanced Moistness
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/enhanced_moistness.mp4
	desc:
		Entities are considered "wet" for 5 seconds after leaving a source of wetness. Additionally,
		lingering or splash water bottles inflict wetness. Also makes wet entities drip to show
		they're wet. Affects various vanilla mechanics including fire and undead burning.

		Touching lava instantly removes wetness, meaning lava blades still work.

mechanics.slowfall_splash_on_inanimates:
	name: Slow Fall Splash On Inanimates
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/slowfall_splash_on_inanimates.mp4
	desc:
		Slow fall splash potions affect inanimates (minecarts, arrows, etc) making them unaffected
		by gravity. They will become normally affected again if they become wet.

		This is kind of overpowered.

mechanics.broken_tools_drop_components:
	name: Broken Gear Drops Components
	since: 1.1.2
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/broken_tools_drop_components.mp4
	link_url: https://github.com/unascribed/Fabrication/blob/trunk/src/main/resources/default_gear_components_config.ini
	link_text: See the default config for more info
	desc:
		Makes gear drop its consituent items when broken. This is completely configurable in
		config/fabrication/gear_components.ini.

		Also works with nonplayer entities, where it is affected by their drop chance table.

mechanics.obsidian_tears:
	name: Obsidian Tears
	since: 1.2.8
	sides: server_only_with_client_helper
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/obsidian_tears.mp4
	short_desc: Lets you set your spawn at a Crying Obsidian block; automatable
	desc:
		Empty bottles can be used to collect "Obsidian Tears" from Crying Obsidian. When quaffed by
		or dispensed onto a player, it updates their spawn to the location of the block the
		tears are from. Dispensers can also be used to fill empty bottles with tears.

		Crying Obsidian respawn works in any dimension and doesn't need to be recharged, but you
		spawn with half health, no saturation, less than full food, and Weakness.

		On client, just gives the bottle a custom appearance instead of a potion item.

mechanics.grindstone_disenchanting:
	name: Grindstone Disenchanting
	since: 1.2.8
	sides: server_and_client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/grindstone_disenchanting.mp4
	desc:
		Placing a book in the bottom slot of a Grindstone when disenchanting an item will transfer
		the enchantments onto the book.

		Doesn't work properly if the client doesn't also have it, but it will not break vanilla
		clients.

mechanics.anvil_repair:
	name: Anvil Repair
	since: 1.2.9
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/anvil_repair.mp4

mechanics.detecting_powered_rails:
	name: Detecting Powered Rails
	since: 2.2.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Allows using a comparator on a powered rail just like a detector rail. Makes minecart
		logistics a lot easier. Also allows using a repeater to do normal detection.

mechanics.directional_powered_rails:
	name: Directional Powered Rails
	since: 2.2.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Placing magenta glazed terracotta under a powered rail makes it push minecarts in the
		direction of the arrow, even from a stop. They also work as hard stops for carts going the
		wrong direction.

		Works similar to a Railcraft Boarding Track.

mechanics.directional_detector_rails:
	name: Directional Detector Rails
	since: 2.2.0
	sides: server_only
