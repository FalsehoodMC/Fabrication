		Bad ideas given form.

experiments.packed_atlases:
	name: Packed Atlases
	since: 1.2.8
	sides: client_only
	desc:
		Disables rounding of atlases to the next power-of-two. GPU drivers have supported "NPOT"
		textures since forever.

		Possibly reduces VRAM usage. May reduce performance. Might cause incompatibilites.

experiments.no_set_window_pos:
	name: No Set Window Pos
	since: 1.3.2
	sides: client_only
	desc:
		Prevents the game from manually modifying the window position. So if you have custom configs
		or something that memorizes window positions, they will be honored instead of the window
		always being centered.
