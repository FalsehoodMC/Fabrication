		on arrows and fireworks, in which case the restrictions will be AND'd with the restrictions
		of the bow or crossbow doing the firing.

		The tag must be a list of strings, which may contain UUIDs that match a specific entity or
		an entity type ID optionally prefixed with a ! to invert the match.

		If installed on the client, adds hit information to the tooltip. You can hide this
		information by creating an NBT byte set to 1 called "HideCanHit".

		For example, a sword that can only hit spiders: /give @p diamond_sword{CanHit:["spider"]}

		A sword that can hit anything but creepers: /give @p diamond_sword{CanHit:["!creeper"]}

	short_desc: Allows customizing kill messages for summoned entities and spawned items

		message when they kill a player. You can use placeholders to show the name of the killed
		entity, the name of the killing entity, or the name of the killing entity's held item, in
		that order.

		For example, "%s found a %s" would show e.g. "unascribed found a Skeleton". You could also
		write this as "%1$s found a %2$s" for the same result, or, say "A %2$s found %1$s" to show
		them in the opposite order, e.g. "A Skeleton found unascribed". The third %s or a %3$s will
		show the item name; if there isn't one, [Air] will be shown.
