		Forge/Fabric version, Java version, approximate window aspect ratio, OpenGL version,
		selected language, operating system name (no version), your selected profile, current
		status of all features, and any mixin failures.

		and to help inform development decisions based on version information.

general.profile:
	name: Profile
	since: 1.0
	desc:
		To help with Fabrication's overwhelming number of options, Profiles let you pick what kinds
		of features you want to be enabled by default. When a config value is set to 'unset', it is
		up to the profile whether it's enabled or disabled.
		
		I don't even like coffee.
