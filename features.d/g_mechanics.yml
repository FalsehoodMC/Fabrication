mechanics.enhanced_moistness:
	name: Enhanced Moistness
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/enhanced_moistness.mp4
	desc:
		Entities are considered "wet" for 5 seconds after leaving a source of wetness. Additionally,
		lingering or splash water bottles inflict wetness. Also makes wet entities drip to show
		they're wet. Affects various vanilla mechanics including fire and undead burning.
		
		Touching lava instantly removes wetness, meaning lava blades still work.

mechanics.slowfall_splash_on_inanimates:
	name: Slow Fall Splash On Inanimates
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/slowfall_splash_on_inanimates.mp4
	desc:
		Slow fall splash potions affect inanimates (minecarts, arrows, etc) making them unaffected
		by gravity. They will become normally affected again if they become wet.
		
		This is kind of overpowered.

	name: Obsidian Tears

	short_desc: Lets you set your spawn at a Crying Obsidian block; automatable
	desc:
		Empty bottles can be used to collect "Obsidian Tears" from Crying Obsidian. When quaffed by
		or dispensed onto a player, it updates their spawn to the location of the block the
		tears are from. Dispensers can also be used to fill empty bottles with tears.
		
		Crying Obsidian respawn works in any dimension and doesn't need to be recharged, but you
		spawn with half health, no saturation, less than full food, and Weakness.
		
		On client, just gives the bottle a custom appearance instead of a potion item.

	name: Grindstone Disenchanting
	since: 1.2.8

	desc:
		Placing a book in the bottom slot of a Grindstone when disenchanting an item will transfer

		clients.
