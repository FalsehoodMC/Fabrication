		Resurrects the Beta 1.2-era animated falling block logo. Because it looked sweet and it is
		shameful they removed it.

		The block logo is completely customizable in config/fabrication/block_logo.png and
		config/fabrication/block_logo.ini. The default is identical to how it was in Beta 1.2.

	short_desc: Draws block drops with a mipmapped or small portion of the texture
	desc:
		Back in Survival Test, likely in the interest of keeping a consistent pixel density in the
		world, block drops were drawn with an 8x8 portion of the block texture. This didn't always
		work well back then, and rather than fix things up and design textures with it in mind, it
		was simply removed.

		This option uses a whitelist in config/fabrication/classic_block_drops.ini to emulate the
		old behavior, and for anything not whitelisted, uses mipmapped textures.

		This looks pretty neat.

	short_desc: Drops blink white like they did in Survival Test
	desc:
		Back in Survival Test, drops blinked white to make them stand out more. This is an
		implementation of that.

		If Utility > Despawning Items Blink is enabled, that tweak's disappear-flashing will be
		disabled, and instead this tweak's white flashing will get faster and faster as despawn
		approaches.
