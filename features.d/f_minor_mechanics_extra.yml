	since: 1.2.3
	sides: server_only
	default: burnt
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/spiders_cant_climb_while_wet.mp4
	desc:
		Makes spiders unable to climb while wet. Basically a more overpowered version of Spiders
		Can't Climb Glazed Terracotta. May break vanilla spider farms.
		
		Interacts with Enhanced Moistness, and the demo video uses it for the water splash to work
		like it does.
