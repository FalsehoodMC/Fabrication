Fabrication is a gigantic collection of vanilla tweaks and small features, most of which work server-side-only. Look ma, no Polymer!

Everything can be configured. Some of the things Fabrication modifies are tridents, note blocks, observers, furnace minecarts, ...

It also contains a facsimile of Apathetic Mobs and Hunger Strike.
