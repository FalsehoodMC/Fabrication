		Small additions to vanilla mechanics.

minor_mechanics.feather_falling_five:
	name: Feather Falling V
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only_with_client_helper
	fscript: living_entity
	fscript_default: ~boots:~enchant~minecraft;feather_falling:enchant_level:5
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/feather_falling_five.mp4
	desc:
		Makes Feather Falling V a valid enchant that completely negates fall damage. Optionally does
		damage to the boots.

		If present on the client, makes the enchantment available in the Creative menu.

minor_mechanics.feather_falling_five_damages_boots:
	name: Feather Falling V Damages Boots

	sides: server_only
	fscript: living_entity
	parent: minor_mechanics.feather_falling_five
	desc:
		Makes absorbing fall damage with Feather Falling V cause damage to the boots.

minor_mechanics.furnace_minecart_any_fuel:
	name: Furnace Minecart Accepts Any Fuel
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/furnace_minecart_any_fuel.mp4
	desc:
		Allows furnace minecarts to accept any furnace fuel, rather than just coal and charcoal.

minor_mechanics.infibows:
	name: InfiBows
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/infibows.mp4
	desc:
		Makes Infinity bows not require an arrow in your inventory to fire.

		If not present on client, firing bows with no arrows is a bit janky.

minor_mechanics.note_blocks_play_on_landing:
	name: Note Blocks Play On Landing
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/note_blocks_play_on_landing.mp4
	desc:
		Makes note blocks play when landed on. The higher the entity fell, the louder the note will
		be. Also triggers Observers.

minor_mechanics.fire_protection_on_any_item:
	name: Fire Protection On Any Item
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/fire_protection_on_any_item.mp4
	desc:
		Fire Protection can be applied to any enchantable item, and makes the item immune to fire
		and lava damage.

minor_mechanics.exact_note_block_tuning:
	name: Exact Note Block Tuning
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/exact_note_block_tuning.mp4
	desc:
		Right-clicking a note block with a stack of sticks sets its pitch to the
		size of the stack minus one.

minor_mechanics.note_block_notes:
	name: Note Block Notes
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/note_block_notes.mp4
	desc:
		Tells you the note the note block has been tuned to when tuning it or playing it manually
		above your hotbar. Also shows the octave, and shows the correct note for the snare and click
		instruments. (The bass drum is hard to nail down and so does not show note or octave info;
		if you know the best way to describe the bass drum, please let me know in an issue.)

minor_mechanics.spiders_cant_climb_glazed_terracotta:
	name: Spiders Can't Climb Glazed Terracotta
	since: 1.0.2
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/spiders_cant_climb_glazed_terracotta.mp4
	short_desc: Makes spiders unable to climb glazed terracotta
	desc:
		Makes spiders unable to climb glazed terracotta, to make farming them less of a chore if you
		go to the trouble to make glazed terracotta.

		Logic: Slime blocks can't stick to glazed terracotta. Are spiders really stickier than solid
		slime?

minor_mechanics.water_fills_on_break:
	name: Water Fills On Break
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/water_fills_on_break.mp4
	short_desc: Water source blocks fill in broken blocks instead of air under some conditions
	desc:
		Water source blocks fill in broken blocks instead of air if there is more water on its
		north, east, south, west, and top faces than there is air on its north, east, south, and
		west faces. In case of a tie, air wins. Makes terraforming lakes and building canals, etc
		much less frustrating.

minor_mechanics.invisibility_splash_on_inanimates:
	name: Invisibility Splash On Inanimates
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/invisibility_splash_on_inanimates.mp4
	desc:
		Invisibility splash potions affect inanimates (minecarts, arrows, etc) making them
		invisible. They will become visible again if they become wet. This enables the vanilla
		"invisible" flag, which doesn't work on inanimates unless Fixes > Inanimates Can Be
		Invisible is also enabled.

		Logic: Invisibility potions coat the outer surface of the object. Living entities absorb and
		eventually eliminate the compound, and when drank it exudes from the pores, but inanimate
		objects do not have metabolisms, so the invisibility hangs around indefinitely unless washed
		off. Don't @ me about skeletons.

minor_mechanics.fire_aspect_is_flint_and_steel:
	name: Fire Aspect Is Flint And Steel
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/fire_aspect_is_flint_and_steel.mp4
	short_desc: Makes Fire Aspect tools act like Flint and Steel
	desc:
		Right-clicking a block with no action with a Fire Aspect tool emulates a click with flint
		and steel, allowing you to light fires and such with a Fire Aspect tool instead of having to
		carry around flint and steel.

		Since it emulates clicking with a Flint and Steel, it's highly compatible.

minor_mechanics.mechanism_muffling:
	name: Mechanism Muffling
	since: 1.2.8
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/mechanism_muffling.mp4
	desc:
		Placing a block of wool adjacent to a dispenser, dropper, or piston makes it silent.

minor_mechanics.crawling:
	name: Crawling
	since: 1.3.0
	sides: server_and_client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/crawling.mp4
	desc:
		Adds a key to explicitly enter the "crawling" stance. No more smushing yourself with a
		trapdoor. Needed on both the server and client, but doesn't break vanilla clients.

		Honors the vanilla "Sneak" Accessibility Option. Interacts with Utility > Toggle Stance.

minor_mechanics.unsaddle_creatures:
	name: Unsaddle Creatures
	since: 1.4.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/unsaddle_creatures.mp4
	desc:
		Shift right click with an empty hand to retrieve a saddle from a pig/strider.

minor_mechanics.cactus_punching_hurts:
	name: Cactus Punching Hurts
	since: 1.4.0
	sides: server_only
	fscript: server_player_entity
	fscript_default: hand:empty
	desc:
		Breaking cactus with your hand will damage you the same as hugging it.

minor_mechanics.tridents_activate_levers:
	name: Tridents Activate Levers
	since: 1.4.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		When a trident hits a lever it will toggle it.

minor_mechanics.protection_on_any_item:
	name: Protection On Any Item
	since: 2.3.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Protection can be applied to any enchantable item.

		It will inclusively protect from:.
		Level 1: cactus, Level 2: fire, Level 3: lava, Level 4: explosions.

minor_mechanics.spreadable_moss:
	name: Spreadable Moss
	since: 3.0.0
	sides: server_only
	desc:
		Using bone meal on a stone block with a moss block nearby grows moss to that block, to make
		it a bit easier to work with for building.

minor_mechanics.channeling_two:
	name: Channeling Two
	since: 3.0.0
	sides: server_only_with_client_helper
	desc:
		Makes Channeling II a valid enchant that works while raining as well.

minor_mechanics.gradual_block_breaking:
	name: Gradual Block Breaking
	since: 3.0.0
	sides: server_only
	fscript: player_entity
	desc:
		Snow layers and slabs will be mined a layer at a time.
