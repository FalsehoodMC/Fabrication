	name: Fixes
	section: true
	since: 1.0
	default: blonde
	desc:
		Fixes for bugs and weird behavior.

fixes.sync_attacker_yaw:
	name: Sync Attacker Yaw
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_and_client
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/sync_attacker_yaw.mp4
	short_desc: Correctly sync the last attacker yaw for damage tilt; fixes MC-26678
	desc:
		Makes the last attacker yaw field sync properly when the player is damaged, instead of
		always being zero. Causes the camera shake animation when being hurt to tilt away from the
		source of damage instead of always tilting right.
		
		Fixes MC-26678, which is closed as Won't Fix.
		
		Needed on both client and server, but doesn't break vanilla clients.

fixes.furnace_minecart_pushing:
	name: Furnace Minecart Pushing
	since: 1.0
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/furnace_minecart_pushing.mp4
	short_desc: Right-clicking a furnace minecart pushes it; silently removed around 17w46a
	desc:
		Right-clicking a furnace minecart with a non-fuel while it's out of fuel gives it a little
		bit of fuel, allowing you to "push" it.
		
		Removed some time after 17w46a (1.13 pre releases); nobody seems to have noticed, and it
		wasn't announced.

fixes.use_player_list_name_in_tag:
	name: Use Player List Name In Tag
	since: 1.0
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/use_player_list_name_in_tag.png
	desc:
		Changes player name tags to match names in the player list. Good in combination with
		nickname mods like Drogtor.

fixes.better_pause_freezing:
	name: Better Pause Freezing
	since: 1.0.1
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/better_pause_freezing.mp4
	short_desc: Makes textures not tick while the game is paused
	desc:
		Makes textures not tick while the game is paused, meaning animated blocks and such properly
		freeze instead of continuing to animate.

fixes.inanimates_can_be_invisible:
	name: Inanimates Can Be Invisible
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: client_only
	desc:
		Makes inanimate entities honor the "invisible" tag sent by the server. Does nothing on its
		own; the server must have something that marks inanimate entities as invisible, such as
		Fabrication's own Invisibility Splash On Inanimates.

fixes.omniscent_player:
	name: Omniscent Player
	since: 1.1.1
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/omniscent_player.mp4
	short_desc: The player render in the inventory always follows your cursor
	desc:
		The player render in the inventory follows your cursor, even if it's not inside the game
		window.

fixes.uncap_menu_fps:
	name: Uncap Menu FPS
	since: 1.2
	sides: client_only
	short_desc: Removes the hardcoded 60 FPS cap in menu screens
	desc:
		Removes the hardcoded 60 FPS cap in menu screens, instead using whatever you have the
		framerate cap set to.
		
		Primarily added because in prior versions the cap was 30 FPS and I thought it still was.
		Maybe this is nice if you have a 144Hz display?

fixes.adventure_tags_in_survival:
	name: Adventure Tags In Survival
	since: 1.2.1
	sides: server_only_with_client_helper
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/adventure_tags_in_survival.mp4
	short_desc: Makes CanDestroy/CanPlaceOn work in Survival
	desc:
		Makes the CanDestroy and CanPlaceOn tags be honored in survival mode instead of just adventure mode.
		
		Only needed on server, but the experience is more seamless if it's also on the client.

fixes.stable_cacti:
	name: Stable Cacti
	since: 1.2.3
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/stable_cacti.mp4
	short_desc: Makes cacti less afraid
	desc:
		Fixes cactuses being made of Explodium due to long-since-fixed engine limitations. In
		English: Makes cacti not break themselves if a block is placed next to them. They will still
		break if they *grow* into such a space, so cactus randomizers and cactus farms still work.

fixes.boundless_levels:
	name: Boundless Levels
	since: 1.2.5
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/boundless_levels.mp4
	short_desc: Fixes enchantment.level.27
	desc:
		Replaces translation strings for potion and enchantment levels with a dynamic algorithm that
		supports arbitrarily large numbers.

	name: Ghast Charging
	since: 1.2.8

	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/ghast_charging.mp4
	short_desc: Brings back the ghast "charging" animation that broke in 1.3
	desc:
		Brings back the ghast "charging" animation when they're about to fire a fireball that got
		broken in 1.3 and removed in 1.8, and never worked in multiplayer.

fixes.no_night_vision_flash:
	name: No Night Vision Flashing
	since: 1.2.9
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/no_night_vision_flash.mp4
	desc:
		Disables the flashing effect when Night Vision is about to run out. This effect ranges from
		"annoying" to "actively dangerous". With this enabled, it just slowly fades out instead.

fixes.multiline_sign_paste:
	name: Multiline Sign Paste
	since: 1.2.10
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/multiline_sign_paste.mp4

		by holding Shift while copying.

	desc:
		Makes "crack" particles honor item coloration, such as leather armor dye.

fixes.silverfish_step:
	name: Silverfish Step
	since: 1.2.10
	sides: server_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/silverfish_step.mp4
	desc:
		Fixes an oversight that prevents silverfish from playing their step sound. It's also
		possible it's not an oversight and that Mojang simply deemed the silverfish step sound too
		horrible and dummied it out.

fixes.open_inventories_in_nether_portal:
	name: Open Inventories in Nether Portals
	since: 1.4.0
	sides: client_only
	media: https://unascribed.com/fabrication/open_inventories_in_nether_portal.mp4
	desc:
		Allows players to open inventories while in a nether portal.
		
		Vanilla originally made this change to fix a dupe exploit in Beta. The underlying cause of
		this dupe was fixed a very long time ago.

fixes.fix_superflat_bad_structures:
	name: Fix Superflat Bad Structures
	since: 1.4.0
	sides: either
	desc:
		Fixes a bug that some biome-adding mods have that causes their structure features to be
		added to a superflat world, which have a hardcoded list of supported structure features.
		
		This bug shows up as a "safe mode" error screen with an exception in the log showing a
		NullPointerException in method_30979.
		
		This will not affect mods that properly patch the superflat structures map.

#fixes.fix_charm_amethyst_dupe:
#	name: Fix Charm Amethyst Dupe
#	since: 2.0.0
#	sides: server_only
#	short_desc: Fixes a bug in Charm caused by bad assumptions that allows generating amethyst shards.
#	desc:
#		Fixes a bug in Charm caused by bad assumptions that allows generating amethyst shards if
#		you have another mod that can make item frames invisible, such as Fabrication's own
#		Invisibility Splash On Inanimates.

	name: Bubble Column Pop
	since: 2.1.0
	sides: client_only
	default: vienna
	desc:
		Re-adds bubble columns having a bubble pop particle and sound at the top.
		
		Was present in 18w07a, got removed before 1.13 release.
