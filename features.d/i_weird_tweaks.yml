weird_tweaks.endermen_dont_squeal:
	name: Endermen Don't Squeal
	since: 1.0
	sides: either
	desc:
		Makes Endermen not make their growling or screeching sounds when angry.

		On client, mutes the sounds for just you. This means angry endermen don't make ambient
		sounds.

		stare sound is client-sided, unfortunately.

	desc:

		glitchily played every tick. Armor equip sounds and other custom equip sounds remain
		unchanged. You won't even notice it's gone.

		On client, mutes it just for you.

		On server, prevents the sound from playing at all for everyone.

	link_text: See the default config for more info
	short_desc: Completely configurable dimensional tool bonuses/penalties
	desc:
		By default, makes breaking nether blocks deal 50x damage to non-golden and non-netherite
		tools, and makes golden tools take 1/50th the damage when breaking the same blocks, bringing
		their durability just above diamond. Also makes wooden tools crafted with nether planks into
		"Fungal" tools, and stone tools crafted with blackstone into "Blackstone" tools, which also
		get the 1/50th damage bonus. Completely configurable; see
		config/fabrication/dimensional_tools.ini.

		On client, adjusts tooltips to show fractional damage.

		Inspired by a joke video.
